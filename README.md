## Milestones

In order to keep work rewarding, we should try to make at least every other milestone be about introducing game mechanics.
Game mechanics are often relatively easy to implement yet are very rewarding in terms of results.
Between game mechanics milestones, we should squeeze in small batches of more demanding investigative work.

Each milestone completion is followed by an attempt to improve quality of life and developer experience.
